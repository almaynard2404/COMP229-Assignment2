    <p>Time's a Tickin' is a 2D Platforming video game developped in Unity2D by myself, Mike Deshane, 
        Yusuke Kuroki and Merak Tandon while enrolled at Centennial College for Game Programming. In this game, you
        take the role of a character named 10-2 a cyborg prototype. As 10-2, you are tasked with stopping an evil villian, with nothing but the power to control time

            <li>Pause and quit game functions</li>
            <li>Bug Fixes</li>
            <li>Helped with camera functions and camera movement</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I also helped with the overall visual asthetic of the game in terms of asset placement(**No assets were made by our group, 
        we had to purchase/obtain them off the Unity asset store), UI design, splashscreens and etc.</p>

    <img src="/content/images/FishBowl.png" alt="FishBowl video game" width="50%">
    <h3>Game Description</h3> 
    <p>Fish Bowl is an upcoming 2D Platforming game being developed by only myself in Unity 2D. 
        In this game, you will play as a fish character named 'Fish Bowl' who travels to the surface world 
        by using a fish tank exo suit. The objective of this game will be to traverse each level before your 
        suit runs out of battery.</p><br><br> 

        <h3>My role</h3>
        <p>Since this project is in early development there is little that I have competed, but so far I'm in the character and world design phase. 
        In addition to this, I plan on doing ALL the art by myself (first time for me) as well as all the programming.</p>
